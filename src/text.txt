The code would also deal with acceptable language and set out the
punishment for students who smoke, destroy property, steal, distribute
hate material or carry a weapon. These are still up for debate.

Johnson believes stricter discipline at schools will produce students
with better grades and young adults with responsible attitudes.

"If students are dressed in a sloppy manner, that kind of habit and
dress may flow over into their learning habits and make it difficult to
conduct proper teaching," he said.

Ontario Premier Mike Harris, 54, believes the province's kids are not
what they used to be. He said he remembers the times depicted in the
1950s TV sitcom, Leave it to Beaver.

Harris, a former teacher and parent to two young boys, said students
need to learn some respect.

"They need to know what the line is," he said Tuesday. "What's
acceptable and what isn't and that there are consequences for going over
that line."

Swearing at a teacher, for example, might mean suspension, Harris said.
For violence, the punishment could be expulsion.

Marshall Jarvis, head of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers'
Association, said schools already have policies in place to handle
unruly students.

"The school is a microcosm of the society around it. There are students
with serious concerns. However to paint a picture that that's a general
trend across Ontario is not something that I've witnessed," he said.
